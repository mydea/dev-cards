## Goal

The goal of the game is to complete your project in as little rounds as possible. The number of rounds is counted and acts as the final indicator of success, the fewer rounds you needed to finish your project the better.

As soon as all win-conditions are met, you have immediately won:

- Reach 100/100 progress
- Have no bugs

## Terms

- Deck: The full deck of cards that you start the game with. This is pre-defined for the player.
- Draw pile: A shuffled series of face-down cards that represents cards that you have not played yet.
- Discard pile: A face-down pile of cards that have been discarded because they have not been played yet.
- Graveyard: A face-down pile of cards that have been played from your hand. Cards in the graveyard can never return to play.
- Progress (%): A step towards completing your project. It is the main goal of the game to collect 100% progress.
- Bug (üêõ): A problem in your code that you must fix. You cannot win the game while you have unfixed bugs.
- Fixing a bug: Removing a single bug.
- Productivity Point (PP): Represents your ability to ship progress. This is the primary resource that is needed to play cards.

   a. You can only play cards if you can satisify _all_ requirements stated on the card.
   b. You have to apply _all_ stated effects on the card in order from top to bottom.
3. _Instead of playing any cards_, you can also discard _all_ cards from your hand and reduce your TD by 2.
4. When you are done with playing cards from your hand, discard the remaining cards from your hand and draw 5 new cards.
   a. If there are no more cards in your draw pile, shuffle the cards from your discard pile and form a new draw pile.
   b. If there are not enough cards to draw a full hand of 5 cards, you have immediately lost the game.
5. Start the next round.

### General Rules

- PP can never fall below 0.
- TD can never exceed 20.
